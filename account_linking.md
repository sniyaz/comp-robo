## Accounts in CS XXXX

Heads up: there are two accounts I expect you to create this semester (if you don't already have them).

### GitHub Account

The first account is for GitHub, since we will use GitHub classroom to submit assignments in this class. You can create a GitHub account [here](https://github.com/signup) if you need one. You can use any email you'd like to sign up, I just need your handle once you have an account. For example, my GitHub handle is [sniyaz](https://github.com/sniyaz).

Don't worry about actually setting up GitHub Classroom or anything like that: just create the account/handle you'll use this semester. We'll walk through GitHub Classroom setup in Lab 1.

#### ⚠️ Account Linking ⚠️

Once you have your GitHub user name, you need to actually tell me what it is (along with your **official** Northeastern email). This will allow me to actually give you credit for the labs you submit on GitHub Classroom.

You can find this all-important form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd02qUq3B4oOqWxRa351NG6RnbJsoXeHwSKl49V2-KdjMZU8Q/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=117727921578247837543): please do this ASAP (preferably before the first day of the class).

### Gradescope Account

You will also use Gradescope in this class for the written portions of some labs. This is also where your graded exams (midterm and final) will be released.

You don't need to create an account yourself; instead, you will receive an email to join our Gradescope course during the first few weeks of class. Once you receive that email, please follow the instructions to set up your account.
